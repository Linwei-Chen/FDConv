# FDConv

**[CVPR 2025]** Official implementation of *Frequency Dynamic Convolution for Dense Image Prediction*.  
FDConv enhances dynamic convolution by learning frequency-diverse weights in the Fourier domain, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter overhead.

The code is being organized.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Fourier Disjoint Weight (FDW):** Constructs frequency-diverse kernels by learning disjoint spectral coefficients, eliminating parameter redundancy.
- **Kernel Spatial Modulation (KSM):** Dynamically adjusts filter responses at the element-wise level using local-global feature fusion.
- **Frequency Band Modulation (FBM):** Modulates spatial-frequency bands adaptively for context-aware feature extraction.
- **Plug-and-Play:** Seamlessly integrates into ConvNets and Transformers.

## üìà Performance Highlights

| Task                  | Method       | Metrics (Improvement)  | Params Cost |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Object Detection      | Faster R-CNN | AP‚Üë2.2%                | **+3.6M**   |
| Instance Segmentation | Mask R-CNN   | AP<sup>mask</sup>‚Üë2.8% | +3.6M       |
| Semantic Segmentation | UPerNet      | mIoU‚Üë3.1%              | +3.6M       |

**Outperforms CondConv (+90M), DY-Conv (+75M), and ODConv (+65M) with 1/20 parameters!**

## üõ† Installation

You can install mmdet following the guidence of [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/dev-2.x).

## üèéÔ∏è Quick Start

```python
from fdconv import FDConv

# Replace standard convolution in your model
model.conv = FDConv(in_channels=64, out_channels=64, kernel_size=3, n_freq_groups=64)
```
